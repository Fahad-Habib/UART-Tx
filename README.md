# UART-Tx

UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) **Tx** implemented from scratch in SystemVerilog at a **Baud Rate** of **9600**.

## UART

UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) is a serial communication device for asynchronous communication in which the data format and transmission speeds are configurable. It sends data bits one by one, from the least significant to the most significant, framed by start and stop bits so that precise timing is handled by the communication channel.
